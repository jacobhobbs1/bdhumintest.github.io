# About Me

I am a first year PhD student within [Open Lab](https://openlab.ncl.ac.uk/) at Newcastle University looking into the role that augmented reality can play in medical surgery. I will be integrating augmented reality with existing technologies and techniques to aid medical professionals with the procedures they undertake. I am looking forward to seeing where I can take my PhD and what I can learn along the way. I jumped straight from undergraduate to PhD as this opportunity within Open Lab arose and I saw it as a means of being creative and supporting a good cause.

I completed my BSc in computer science here at Newcastle University focussing my final dissertation on the development process of digital twins. During this project I built a digital twin of an F1Tenth car as a case study and employed an introspective approach to suggest guidelines for future digital twin development. This way of thinking was very new to me but it was interesting to experience how a case study can be used to draw wider lessons. I thoroughly enjoyed this project as it introduced me to a field I had no prior experience of and taught me about the potential that digital twins have in many modern systems.

When I am not working I spend a large amount of time riding my bike through the North Pennines, and as president of the [University Cycling Club](https://www.facebook.com/newcastleuniversitycyclingclub) I enjoy showing new students the routes I have come to love. I also enjoy cooking and experimenting with any new flavour combinations I can find
