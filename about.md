# About Me

I am a first year PhD student within [Open Lab](https://openlab.ncl.ac.uk/) at Newcastle University looking into the role that augmented reality can play in medical surgery. I will be integrating augmented reality with existing technologies and techniques to aid medical professionals with the procedures they undertake. I am looking forward to seeing where I can take my PhD and what I can learn along the way. I jumped straight from undergraduate to PhD as this opportunity within Open Lab arose and I saw it as a means of being creative and supporting a good cause.

I completed my BSc in computer science here at Newcastle University focussing my final dissertation on the development process of digital twins. During this project I built a digital twin of an F1Tenth car as a case study and employed an introspective approach to suggest guidelines for future digital twin development. This way of thinking was very new to me but it was interesting to experience how a case study can be used to draw wider lessons. I thoroughly enjoyed this project as it introduced me to a field I had no prior experience of and taught me about the potential that digital twins have in many modern systems.

When I am not working I spend a large amount of time riding my bike through the North Pennines, and as president of the [University Cycling Club](https://www.facebook.com/newcastleuniversitycyclingclub) I enjoy showing new students the routes I have come to love. I also enjoy cooking and experimenting with any new flavour combinations I can find.

I am a third year PhD student within Open Lab looking into the role that augmented reality can play in the medical field. I am looking at how augmented reality can integrate with existing technologies and techniques to speed up or otherwise improve a medical workflow. I am also looking into the interaction challenges of AR and how virtual components could be redesigned to enhance interactions. I spent the first year of my PhD interviewing various surgeons and radiologists in the North East with the aim of understanding current process and how augmented reality could be integrated with current systems to have a meaningful impact. 
I am also explore the perceptual issues of augmented reality, in particular depth perception. Accurate depth perception is crucial to the effective use of AR in the medical field and beyond, but limitations of modern hardware make this difficult in certain use cases. 

I completed my bachelors in computer science here at Newcastle University, focussing my final dissertation on the development processes of digital twins, during which I built a digital twin of an F1Tenth car as a case study. In the summer of 2022, before starting my PhD I completed a summer placement within the EPiC (Educational Practices in Computing) research group in the school of computing. During this placement I built on existing games development knowledge to create a command line interface simulator for students to use to help them learn basic commands in a safe environment. This was an interesting process that allowed me to build on and solidify my knowledge of command line interfaces.

## Teaching Experience

Along side my PhD I have undertaken some demonstrating work helping to support undergraduate and masters modules. One of these modules is the third year undergraduate Human Computer Interaction: Interaction Design. I have particularly enjoyed demonstrating on this module as it has encouraged me to learn about interaction design principles and concepts that I previously had little knowledge of. Engaging with and helping lead the seminars in this module has been particularly rewarding as they provide the opportunity to engage in thought provoking discussions with students.
