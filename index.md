[About Me](./about) | [News](./news) | [Publications](./publications)

I am a second year PhD student within Open Lab looking into the role that augmented reality can play in the medical field. I will be integrating augmented reality with existing technologies and techniques to speed up or otherwise improve a medical workflow. I am also looking into the interaction challenges of AR and how virtual components could be redesigned to enhance interactions.

I completed my bachelors in computer science here at Newcastle University, focussing my final dissertation on the development process of digital twins, during which I built a digital twin of an F1Tenth car as a case study.
