My <img class="profile-picture" src="/assets/ProfilePicture.png"> name is Bodun (though I usually go by Edward). I'm a CS PhD student in the [UTNS](https://utns.cs.utexas.edu/) lab at [UT Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/) ü§ò.  I am advised by [Aditya Akella](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~akella/) and work closely with [Neeraja Yadwadkar](https://sites.utexas.edu/neeraja/). Before I started my PhD, I was fortunate enough to collaborate closely with professor [Christopher Rossbach](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~rossbach/) on heterogeneous computing systems at [SCEA group](https://github.com/utcs-scea). I also worked with professor [Simon Peter](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~simpeter/) on programmable switches.

I am a first year PhD student within Open Lab looking into the role that augmented reality can play in medical surgery. I will be integrating augmented reality with existing technologies and techniques to aid surgeons with the procedures they undertake. I‚Äôm looking forward to seeing where I can take my PhD and what I can learn along the way.

I completed my bachelors here at Newcastle University focussing my final dissertation on the development process of digital twins, during which I built a digital twin of an F1Tenth car as a case study. I thoroughly enjoyed this experience and learnt a lot about the potential that digital twins have in modern systems.

When I‚Äôm not studying I spend an inordinate amount of time riding my bike through the North Pennines, and as president of the university Cycling Club I look forward to showing new students the routes I have come to love. This being part of the reason I wanted to stay in Newcastle after my undergraduate degree. I also enjoy cooking and experimenting with any new flavour combinations I can find
