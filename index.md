I am a first year PhD student within Open Lab looking into the role that augmented reality can play in medical surgery. I will be integrating augmented reality with existing technologies and techniques to aid surgeons with the procedures they undertake. I’m looking forward to seeing where I can take my PhD and what I can learn along the way.

I completed my bachelors here at Newcastle University focussing my final dissertation on the development process of digital twins, during which I built a digital twin of an F1Tenth car as a case study. I thoroughly enjoyed this experience and learnt a lot about the potential that digital twins have in modern systems.

When I’m not studying I spend an inordinate amount of time riding my bike through the North Pennines, and as president of the university Cycling Club I look forward to showing new students the routes I have come to love. This being part of the reason I wanted to stay in Newcastle after my undergraduate degree. I also enjoy cooking and experimenting with any new flavour combinations I can find
