# Projects and Repositories

This page contains a collection of projects and Github repositories to collect together access to past projects and helpful references for the future. 

> [Microsoft HoloLens 2 Development](https://jacobhobbs1.github.io/HoloLens2Development.github.io/)
This is a collection of the knowledge I have gained through developing for the Microsoft HoloLens 2 with the Unity Game engine. 
Through my experience I have found that the community developing for the HoloLens is very small and therefore there are a lot 
of unanswered questions. This project is a collection of what I have learned made publically available for others to read and 
contribute to.

> [Setup and Config Files](https://jacobhobbs1.github.io/setup-config-files/)
This is a collection of set up and configuration files as starting points for development. For example a .gitignore file to use 
when creating a Unity project.
