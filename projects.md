# Projects and Repositories

This page contains a collection of projects and Github repositories to collect together access to past projects and helpful references for the future. 

> [Microsoft HoloLens 2 Development](https://jacobhobbs1.github.io/HoloLens2Development.github.io/)
This is a collection of the knowledge I have gained through developing for the Microsoft HoloLens 2 with the Unity Game engine. Through my experience I have found that the community developing for the HoloLens is very small and therefore there are a lot of unanswered questions. This project is a collection of what I have learned made publically available for others to read and contribute to.

> [Setup and Config Files](https://jacobhobbs1.github.io/setup-config-files/)
This is a collection of set up and configuration files as starting points for development. For example a .gitignore file to use when creating a Unity project.

> [Command Line Interface Simmulator](https://jacobhobbs1.github.io/Command-Line-Interface-Sim/)
This project was developed through my summer placement working within the Educational Practices in Computing (EPiC) research group in the School of Computing at Newcastle University. This project aimed to provide a safe environment for students to learn how to use the command line.
